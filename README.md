## Description

This is a machine learning-powered web application built using Flask. It predicts the potential career outcome of employees based on their profile data, such as joining year, payment tier, age, experience, and education level. The app allows users to input their details via a form, and the model predicts the outcome based on trained data. The web app is deployed on Vercel for production use.

### Features:
- Input form for employee details: joining year, payment tier, age, ever benched status, experience, gender, and education level.
- Predicted career outcome displayed upon form submission.
- Simple and intuitive user interface for easy interaction.
- Secure model loading with file path handling.
